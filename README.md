# SLogo (Simple Logo)

A simple version of the coding language, Logo. This project was built to replicate the basic commands of Logo allowing users to manipulate a small bird (rather than a turtle common in most variations of Logo).

### Goals
This is an independent, personal project to not only learn best practices in component management and architecture, but also to build a complete app using React.

### Setup
Visit https://atanada.github.io/SLogo/ to use.

### Available commands
Move the bird around and draw shapes using the following commands:
* forward
* back
* right
* left 
* repeat
* clear (clears canvas)

Example command: `repeat 4 [forward 100 right 90]` \
This command tells the bird to do the combination of move forward by 100 paces then turn right 90 degrees 4 times.
